# Tic-Tac-Toe-game
A classic command-line implementation of Tic Tac Toe in Python. This game allows two players to take turns placing their marks ('X' or 'O') on a 3x3 grid. The objective is to align three marks in a row, column, or diagonal to win. The game continues until one player wins or all cells are filled, resulting in a draw.
